He was a hepatitis B carrier and had hypertension, bronchial asthma, and was not under a medical treatment. He experienced slight fever on Day 1 and was admitted to a nearby hospital on Day 4 with prolonged high fever (> 39 °C) and shortness of breath. The Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test revealed poorly controlled diabetes with a value of 9.4%. The PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was positive, and he was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Day 7. He received intensive drug treatment, including ciclesonide, lopinavir/ritonavir and systemic corticosteroids, as well as respiratory care. Despite these treatments, his respiratory condition deteriorated, and he underwent tracheal intubation (23 cm deep from the mouth) for mechanical ventilation on Day 11. After his transfer to our hospital on Day 12, favipiravir was added to the drug regimen to improve the general condition. However, the patient's condition did not improve despite these intensive treatments. Because of the prolonged tracheal intubation, a tracheostomy was performed after consultation with the anesthesiologists, medical staff in the intensive care unit (ICU), and the infection prevention and control team. Surgical tracheostomy was performed on Day 28 in a negative-pressure airborne infection isolation room in our ICU. Fig. 1 shows the patient's clinical course and chest radiological findings before tracheostomy was performed. After the tracheostomy, his respiratory condition improved by Day 35, and thus he was considered for transfer to the other hospital.",,

On February 4, 2020, a 50-year-old female patient, who is a businesswoman, presented with chief complaints of “fever for one week, diarrhea, anorexia, and asthenia,” and she was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Fever Clinic of Xiangyang First People’s Hospital Affiliated to Hubei Medical College. The patient had a five-day business trip in Wuhan (from January 22, 2020, to January 27, 2020). Fever initially occurred on January 28, 2020, with a body temperature of 38.5°C, with dry cough and muscle ache. On January 30, 2020, the patient went to Xiangyang First People’s Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for consultation in the respiratory department, and the laboratory test reported that the influenza A virus serology was negative. The results of blood routine examination were normal [white blood cell count (WBC): 5.1×109/l; neutrophil percentage (neu%): 69.2%; lymphocyte percentage (lym%): 25.6%; lymphocyte absolute value (lym): 1.28×109/l; C-reactive protein (CRP): 6.1 mg/l] and she was given Tamiflu (75 mg/time, twice per day) orally and was rehydrated. Three days later (on February 2, 2020), the patient still had dry cough, so she went to hospital (TCM) again. It was noted that before the onset of the disease, the patient went to Wuhan on a business trip and a novel coronavirus nucleic acid test was performed and it was negative. At admission, chest X-ray showed increased and thickened right lower lung markings, which suggested bronchitis and possible interstitial pneumonia according to her positive family history of interstitial pneumonia (Figure 1). Levofloxacin was given drip once for intravenous treatment, and Tamiflu was continued to be taken orally. On February 04, 2020, the patient's symptoms were still not improved, and her body temperature continued to rise to 39.2°C. She was referred to our fever clinic for further evaluation, and a chest computed tomography (CT) was performed.
