# Computer Vision Portfolio

Welcome to my Computer Vision portfolio! This repository contains a collection of projects I have worked on in the field of computer vision. Each project includes a brief description, the tools and technologies used, and the outcomes achieved. The code and relevant datasets are available in each project repository.

## Table of Contents:
* **Project 1 :** [Stitch and Post-Processing Panoramas using OpenCV](/StitchAndPostProcess)
* **Project 2 :** [Video Stabilization Using OptialFlow](/VideoStabilizationUsingOptialFlow)
* **Project 3 :** [COVID-19 Detection from X-rays using Transfer Learning](/ChestXrayDetectorUsingTransferLearnings)



## Project 1: Stitching and Post-processing Panoramas using OpenCV:
This is a computer vision project where I have implemented an algorithm to stitch multiple images together to create a panorama. I have used OpenCV and Python to implement the algorithm, and also included post-processing techniques such as blending and warping to improve the quality of the stitched image.

## Project 2: Video Stabilization using Optical Flow:
This is a video processing project where I have implemented an algorithm to stabilize shaky videos using optical flow. The algorithm uses OpenCV to compute the optical flow between consecutive frames and then applies a smoothing filter to remove the camera shake. The resulting video is smooth and stable.

## Project 3: COVID-19 Detection from X-rays using Transfer Learning:
This is a deep learning project where I have trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify chest X-ray images into two categories: COVID-positive and COVID-negative. The model was built using TensorFlow and Keras and achieved an accuracy of 98% on the test set.

## Dependencies
The projects in this repository use the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using pip.

```
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
Each project is contained in its own directory, and includes a README file with detailed instructions on how to run the project and use its functionalities.

## Conclusion
This Computer Vision Portfolio showcases my skills in image processing, computer vision, and machine learning. I have implemented various projects using popular libraries such as TensorFlow and OpenCV, and have included detailed instructions on how to use and run each project.
